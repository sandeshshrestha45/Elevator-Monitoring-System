#  Elevator Monitoring System for Warehouse Safety

##  Project Overview

The **Elevator Monitoring System** is a real-time computer vision-based safety solution designed to enhance warehouse operations and prevent accidents involving forklifts and elevator doors. This system detects the state of the elevator doorâ€”**Open**, **Closed**, or **Sliding**â€”and issues alerts during hazardous conditions. If a forklift attempts to enter the elevator while the door is in the **Sliding** state, the system automatically captures the **forklift's number plate** for incident logging and review.

##  Key Features

-  **Real-Time Elevator Door State Detection**: Uses a vision-based model to classify door states as:
  - `Open`
  - `Closed`
  - `Sliding`

- ðŸš¨ **Warning System for Sliding State**:
  - Audio alert when the elevator is in the **Sliding** state to notify nearby personnel.
  
-  **Forklift Violation Detection**:
  - Detects and logs instances where a forklift enters the elevator during the Sliding state.
  - Captures and stores the **number plate** of the violating forklift.

-  **Warehouse Safety and Compliance**:
  - Helps prevent accidents due to premature forklift entry.
  - Useful for compliance, monitoring, and training.
